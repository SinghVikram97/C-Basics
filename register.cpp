  // If you use & operator with a register variable then compiler may give an error or warning
  // it may be stored in a register instead of memory and accessing address of a register is invalid.

  // register keyword can be used with pointer variables. Obviously, a register can have address of a memory location

  // Register is a storage class, and C doesnâ€™t allow multiple storage class specifiers for a variable.
  // So, register can not be used with static .

  // Register can only be used within a block (local), it can not be used in the global scope (outside main).

  // IMP
  // There is no limit on number of register variables in a C program,
  // but the point is compiler may put some variables in register and some not.
